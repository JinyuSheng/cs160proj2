<p>BibDesk can maintain a separate store of macro definitions which are not
associated with a particular document.  Many users store their <samp>`@string'</samp>
definitions in a separate file, or perhaps maintain abbreviated and full versions
of the definitions.  Unfortunately, BibDesk doesn't know about the relationships
between these files, so the macros are only shown in their abbreviated form 
unless they are added to the global macro definitions.
</p>
<p>Macro definitions can also be found in bibliography style files (<samp>`.bst'</samp>
extension), such as this example from <samp>`apalike.bst'</samp>:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre>MACRO {ibmjrd} {"IBM Journal of Research and Development"}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>These definitions, along with <samp>`@string'</samp> definitions, can be copied and pasted
or dragged into the global macro editor window.  In fact, you can paste the entire
contents of a <samp>`.bst'</samp> or <samp>`.bib'</samp> file into the window, and it will extract
the relevant parts for you!
</p>
<p>If you want to add these definitions to a file, you can copy and paste or drag and
drop them into a document's macro editor as well (see <a href="BibDeskHelp_24.html#SEC55">Editing a Document's Macro Definitions</a>
for more details).  A document's definitions will always override the global definitions,
in case of a conflict.
</p>
<p>You can also add a collection of files from which global macro definitions will be 
read on startup. You will not see those macros in the macro editor, 
but they will be used when no other macro definition is found in the document or the global macros. 
You can add are either bibliography files (<samp>`.bib'</samp> extension) or bibliography style 
files (<samp>`.bst'</samp> extension). To add files from which global macros are read, click the 
"Files<small>...</small>" button in the Defaults preference pane.
