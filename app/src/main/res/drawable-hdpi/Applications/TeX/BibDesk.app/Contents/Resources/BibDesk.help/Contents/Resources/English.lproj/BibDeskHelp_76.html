<p>AutoFile lets you choose a folder as your "Papers Folder" to
automatically move files into when you link to them. You can do this
to all files at once, or automatically as they are added. Use this
preference pane to select the Papers Folder and to choose whether to
automatically move files. 
</p>
<p><img src="gfx/autoFilePrefs.png" alt="gfx/autoFilePrefs">
</p>
<p>The upper series of checkboxes defines the base path to which the Local File format will
be applied.  This may be an absolute (fixed) or relative path.  Relative paths are
specified as a POSIX path relative to the document's path.
</p>
<a name="IDX66"></a><META name="keywords" content="File papers in fixed location"><p><b>File papers in fixed location:</b> Papers that are automatically filed by BibDesk will 
be moved to this folder or a subfolder. The format string used to generate the location of the 
moved papers is relative to this folder. When the papers folder is empty, the folder 
containing the document to which the items belong will be used. To get this behavior, deselect 
the checkbox.
</p>
<a name="IDX67"></a><META name="keywords" content="File papers relative to each document"><p><b>File papers relative to each document:</b> When this option is selected, the Local File format 
format will be appended to the BibTeX document's folder path; to modify this, insert a
relative path as the first part of your format.
This option is only available when the papers folder is empty. When you choose this option, 
make sure that any document is saved before activating AutoFile. 
</p>
<a name="IDX68"></a><META name="keywords" content="File papers automatically"><p><b>File papers automatically:</b> When you select this option, BibDesk will automatically 
move files into the papers folder hierarchy for new items. The new location will be build 
using a format string, which you can supply using the other controls. 
See <a href="BibDeskHelp_47.html#SEC96">AutoFile</a> for more information about the Auto File feature. 
</p>
<a name="IDX69"></a><META name="keywords" content="Local File Format"><p><b>Local File Format:</b> You can choose from several default cite key
formats. Choosing "Custom" allows you to set the cite key
format string to any valid format.
</p>
<a name="IDX70"></a><META name="keywords" content="Warn before moving a folder"><p><b>Warn before moving a folder:</b> If you want to be warned before the auto file 
feature moves a folder, for example if you have accidentally linked your Home folder, 
rcheck this option.
</p>
<p>For a more detailed control over the cite key generation, choose the 
"Advanced" button. This will reveal a editing sheet with 
the following additional items. 
</p>
<p><img src="gfx/autoFilePrefs-Advanced.png" alt="gfx/autoFilePrefs-Advanced">
</p>
<a name="IDX71"></a><META name="keywords" content="Preset Format"><p><b>Preset Format:</b> This is a copy of the popup button in the main pane.
</p>
<a name="IDX72"></a><META name="keywords" content="Format String"><p><b>Format String:</b> This text field shows the format string that is used to 
automatically generate new locations for auto filed papers. The Local File 
format string can contain several special format specifiers, which are
a %-character followed by a specifier character and optionally zero to
two numbers. See <a href="BibDeskHelp_91.html#SEC159">Autogeneration Format Syntax</a> for a
more detailed description of the syntax. The generated string is interpreted 
as a file path relative to the Papers Folder. 
</p>
<a name="IDX73"></a><META name="keywords" content="Choose a format specifier to add"><p><b>Choose a format specifier to add:</b> This allows you to easily
add format specifiers at the end of the format string. This popup
button will only be visible in custom mode.
</p>
<a name="IDX74"></a><META name="keywords" content="Generate lowercase file names"><p><b>Generate lowercase file names:</b> Selecting this option will generate 
paths in all lowercase characters. 
</p>
<a name="IDX75"></a><META name="keywords" content="Clean by removing"><p><b>Clean by removing:</b> You can set additional cleaning of generated parts 
of the parsed format string. Braces are normally used in BibTeX to protect parts of 
a string from capitalization. You can choose to remove those braces from the 
generated cite key. You can additionally choose to remove TeX commands. This will 
also remove the braces. The Windows option will remove also characters that are illegal 
in file names on Windows systems, so you can share the files with a Windows machine. 
Choosing the Non-ASCII option will ensure that the generated file name contains 
only ASCII characters; accented characters are converted if possible.
