</p>
<p>If you have a source of references that isn't in a structured form,
you can use the "Add New Publications from Clipboard" menu item in the
"Publication" menu (or the key shortcut &#8997;&#8984;L
) to open a
sheet that lets you add references by selecting text and assigning
that text to fields in a new reference. You can also choose the 
"Add New Publications from File" menu item (key shortcut &#8679;&#8984;L
) 
to add references from an arbitrary text file, or the 
"Add New Publications from Web" menu item (key shortcut &#8984;L
), 
to add publactions from a website. 
</p>
<p>If the clipboard or the file contains formatted text that BibDesk can understand, 
such as BibTeX, RIS, Medline (PubMed), MARC, JSTOR, and ISI Web of Science formatted text, 
Bibdesk will parse the text and the new references are immediately added to the database 
instead of openingthe sheet to do it by hand. 
</p>
<p>Examples of reference sources that this would be convenient for are
emails, conference proceedings web sites, and the text from a list of
citations at the end of a publication.
</p>
<p>When the sheet opens, it loads the data on the clipboard into the
left-hand side of the sheet. If the last thing you've copied was text,
it will show that text. If the text is a URL, it will instead load
that URL and display the web page. If you know you want to use a web
page that is not on the clipboard, you can use the "Add New
Publication from Web" menu item instead.
</p>
<p>The "Open" button gives you the option to choose other sources of
information. If the sheet is displaying a website, there are navigation
controls, including back, forward, and a button for reload and stop.
</p>
<p>Using the contextual menu on the web page, you can bookmark pages to
come back to at a later time, or save the URL of a link or the page
itself as the URL or Local-Url fields for the current publication.
</p>
<p>The right hand side is a table representation of a publication. You
can choose its type and it will load the appropriate field names to
edit. As you add data, it will update the citation key with the
current suggested citation key according to the format set in the 
<a href="BibDeskHelp_75.html#SEC138">Cite Key</a> Preferences.
When you are done editing, choose "Add" to add the current
item to the document, then "Close" when you are done adding.
</p>
<p>The sheet is designed to make this common task more efficient. Select
the text from the source on the left, and you can drag or copy and
paste into the table on the right to fill in the publication's
information. Edit and make any other changes you want by
double-clicking on the rightmost column of the table.
</p>
<a name="IDX1"></a><META name="keywords" content="<code>Cmd-0 - Cmd-9</code>"><a name="IDX2"></a><META name="keywords" content="<code>Cmd-=</code>">
<p>You can make adding data faster by double-clicking the name of
the field you want the selected text to fill and it will be added for
you. You can also use the key shortcuts &#8984;&#0048
 through &#8984;9
 or 
&#8997;&#8984;&#0048
 through &#8997;&#8984;9
 to copy the selected text over to the 
corresponding field. If you hold down the Control key at the same time, 
the selected text will be appended to the field value. 
Alternatively, you can type &#8984;=
 to temporarily 
move to the table to select a field to fill. After that, start typing 
the field name or use the arrow keys to find the field and hit the 
Enter key to fill it and return to what you were doing. Use the 
Tab or Escape key to just go back without filling the field.
